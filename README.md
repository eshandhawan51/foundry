# `foundry`
Custom repository for Arch Linux that builds the packages on the fly from AUR.

## Roadmap
- [ ] Build packages on demand and serve them
- [ ] Use LRU cache for packages
- [ ] Allow storing packages in multiple backends (Local disk, AWS S3, GCS)
- [ ] Implement authentication on certain endpoints. For example only allowing authenticated users to build a new package.
- [ ] Add ABS support

## Contributing
